Hi Rachel,

I'm attaching an updated PDF with the regression tables plus a formatted descriptives table. I wasn't sure whether to include Gini and diversity for the US in this table. I could perhaps add them at bottom in a mini-table, let me know what you think. In any event, here are U.S. stats for the time being for your own records. Note that I am excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico from all analyses. I will start drafting a table summarizing the data sources and calculations. When would be a good time to talk next? Does Wed 4pm work for you? 

**GINI**
 
1990: 0.45
2000: 0.46
2008-2012: 0.49

**Diversity**

Note: this is the scaled value. All values are scaled 0-1 in all models and maps, etc.

1990: 0.50
2000: 0.61
2010: 0.67
